            "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.</p><p><br></p><p>$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.</p><p><br></p><p>The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Whale Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</p>",

The accident begins with the research revealing Alameda Research's collateral was dominated by FTX's native token $FTT.

There were also major amounts of $SOL and $SRM tokens. Mr. Bankman-Fried was an early investor in the Solana chain and the co-founder of the Serum exchange.</p><p>It sparked a run on FTX, with panicked customers withdrawing billions of dollars from the exchange. $FTT token crashed by more than 95% in 24 hours. $SOL was also affected by the accident and by the recent on-chain activity that 49,000,000 $SOL tokens were withdrawn from the staking which caused the token price to drop by approximately 60%.

Ivanov has since pledged to slowly liquidate the debt without causing the coin to depeg. To manage the debt, Vires has limited withdrawals to $1,000 $USD per user per day. The company sporadically adds liquidity to Vires, which is quickly withdrawn. $USDN has managed to restore its $1 peg for a brief period and then lost a peg multiple times. In the end, the token lost its peg permanently and was rebranded, and now it is not stablecoin anymore.

The unexpected outflows led to Multichain’s Fantom Bridge losing its entire holdings in wBTC, USDC, USDT, and a handful of altcoins, worth over $130 million in total. Similar outflows were observed from Multichain’s Moonriver and Dogecoin bridge contracts. The assets transferred out of the Multichain Fantom bridge include DAI, LINK, USDT, wBTC, wETH, and USDC.

This caused USDN to fall by more than 15% to $0.83, wiping out $200 million in the process. Users need to lock in WAVES in Neutrino's smart contracts to mint USDN, and USDN redemptions have the opposite effect of destroying the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply.</p><p><br></p><p>The fall in WAVES price comes after several Twitter handles accused the Waves team of manipulating the price of its native token through its decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Vires.finance. Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov dismissed the allegations and accused Alameda Research of manipulating the prices of WAVES. On Sunday, Ivanov submitted a new governance proposal, supposedly to keep speculative activities at bay. However, Crypto Twitter is up in arms against the proposal, calling it an attempt to subvert the system in favor of insiders and a \"rug pull\" on everyone who used the platform in good faith. Vires.finance is losing liquidity amid the controversy, with the total value locked in the DeFi platform dropping to $945 million from a record $1.26 billion in three days.</p>",

According to on-chain data, the attacker carried out multiple transactions and was able to steal nearly $196 million (<span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>$8.7 million in Dai, $18.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, $135.8 million in Staked Ethereum, and $33.8 million in Circle's USD stablecoin, USDC</span>). Meta Seluth, a crypto analytic firm, reported that the attack is similar to a deflation attack that took place one month prior. The attacker leveraged a multichain bridge to transfer funds from the BNB Smart Chain to Ethereum and then launched the attack. The funds were later deposited into Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploit txs:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc310a0affe2169d1f6feec1c63dbc7f7c62a887fa48795d327d4d2da2d6b111d</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47ac3527d02e6b9631c77fad1cdee7bfa77a8a7bfd4880dccbda5146ace4088f</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3097830e9921e4063d334acb82f6a79374f76f0b1a8f857e89b89bc58df1f311</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x465a6780145f1efe3ab52f94c006065575712d2003d83d85481f3d110ed131d9</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x62bd3d31a7b75c098ccf28bc4d4af8c4a191b4b9e451fab4232258079e8b18c4</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71a908be0bef6174bccc3d493becdfd28395d78898e355d451cb52f7bac38617</p><p><br></p><p>Attacker addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f259d0b76665c337c6104145894f4d1d2758b8c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2698c2d99ad2c302a95a8db26b08d17a77cedd4</p><p><br></p><p>Attacker contracts:&nbsp;</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xebc29199c817dc47ba12e3f86102564d640cbf99</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x036cec1a199234fc02f72d29e596a09440825f1c</p>",
